# Ruby-Games-Scripts
These are classic games such as Hangman, Sudoku, Guessing Game, Pig, Rock-Paper-Scissors, &amp; Anagrams (von-anagram.herokuapp.com). Many of these scripts are by Steve Pugh from "Wicked Cool Ruby Scripts". I refactored them to loop so you can play in the terminal, but I haven't had a chance to get each one into it's own url using Sinatra and Heroku. The purpose of the exercise was to remake loved, child-hood games to add new elements such as using 2 players to interact with the computer for Hangman. These games get a fast following, because subconsciously, we recognize these child-hood gaming techniques. Instead of re-inventing the wheel to come up with new games every couple years, why not refactor old games into various new learning games and introduce them to the market every couple months.
